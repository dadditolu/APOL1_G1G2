# APOL1_G1G2
***Repository for a project that will showcase the global frequencies of APOL1 genetic variants***

## Welcome!

First and foremost, a big Welcome to you!

Thank you for taking out time to visit the **APOL1_G1G2** project repository.

This document (README file) will provide you with some information about the project. We are keen to hear your views and have your input in any way deem fit. Please scroll down to find out more about this project.

## The Project

### Background

Chronic disease of the kidneys (an organ that helps us to get rid of waste in our bodies) affects 10% of the world's population. People of recent African ancestry, irrespective of where they live, are at greater risk of developing this condition. Much of this risk is attributed to having 2 copies of genetic variant of *APOL1*. These variants are **G1** and **G2**

### Problem
  - Although sequencing data is available for several individuals on their APOL1 genotype, there is no single go-to resource that provides a summary of these variants and their global distribution.


### Proposed Solution
  - Create an interactive world map that shows the distribution of these variants on a country-by-country or continent-by-continent basis using publicly available datasets
  - We want to make this map an up-to-date one that reflects changes as new sequencing data is available on publicly accessible databases
